# Chrome Translator Extension

We built this extension to make the web more accessible for everyone, regardless of the language they speak. It allows you to instantly translate entire webpages using the Google Translate API, breaking down language barriers and making online content universally accessible.

This was our first time building a Chrome extension, and it was a great learning experience moving from traditional web development to the extension architecture.
